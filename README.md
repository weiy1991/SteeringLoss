# SteeringLoss: Theory and Application for Steering Prediction

## Overview
---
This repository contains kernel algorithms of SteeringLoss framework based on Nvidia model for the imbanlaced training problem. This paper has been submitted to IV2019.

The overview of the imbalanced training for steering prediction is as following:
